              Eco-Friendly</span></h2>        </div>        <div style="text-align: center;" id="inside_div">Eco-Friendly is an          android application that allows users to track their<br>          Daily CO2 emissions in a hands-free manner. The application follows<br>          the user in their daily activities and finds out what kind of          transportation<br>          they use during their trips. Eco-Friendly understands when the user          ends a trip<br>          in order to find out how long it took them to find the means of          transportation they used<br>          on that specific trip. The application uses a database for cars so the          user <br>          can easily choose what car they use on their daily trips to calculate          the total amount<br>          of CO2 emitted for that trip. Likewise, if they are using the DC          public transportation system, <br>          the application will figure out how long the user was on that          bus/metro train for and calculate<br>          how much CO2 they emitted. This makes users much more conscious of how          much CO2 they<br>          are emitting daily. The goal of this application is to make users lessen          their CO2 content by <br>          keeping track of their CO2 emissions.<br>          <br>          <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            </div>          <ul>          </ul>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
