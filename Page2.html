                  My name is Thomchelik Tunca and I am a Turkish American                  student studying at the George <br>                  Washington University. My family and I currently live in                  Chicago, IL. I am currently a Bachelor of Science <br>                  student in Computer Science looking to graduate Spring 2016,                  and have accepted emplyment at Infosys. <br>                  My duel citizenship allows me to see a whole different part of                  the planet that most Americans do not have the chance to see.                  That being said, I see a problem in both parts of the planet,                  and that is air pollution, namely CO2 pollution <br>                  from burning fossil fuels.&nbsp; After seeing how bad Istanbul                  is since I was a little boy I always wanted<br>                  to do my part and help clean the world up. I always tried to                  pick up garbage on the street, or joined environmental<br>                  clubs since I can remember. Then senior design came along and                  gave me a chance to help the environment in a whole<br>                  new way; technologically. Other interests I have include                  friends, family, skiing, and sports.</span></span></div>            <ul>            </ul>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
